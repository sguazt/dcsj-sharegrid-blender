HOW-TO "MAKE A MOVIE FROM IMAGES"
------------------------------------

You have just rendered a few thousands frames: to put them together, for producing the complete animation, you can use "FFMPEG" as follows.

Let's suppose your frames are named 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg and so on. The command line for "FFMPEG", for merging these frames, is:

  ffmpeg -b <bitrate> -i %04d.jpg <output.avi>

where:
* <bitrate> is the desired video bitrate (i.e., quality of the animation); the default value is 200k (i.e., 200 Kbit/s);
* <%04d.jpg> is the format of the input files;
* <output.avi> is the name for the resulting video file. 

Note, the same command works for other kind of images too, like PNG, GIF, etc.

For additional information see FFMPEG(1) manual page or go to the FFMPEG site (http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/).
